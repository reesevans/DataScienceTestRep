# This is a test document file

The purpose of this docuemnt is to test whether this document, or any document so formed and so edited can long endure.

We are met in the vim editor of that document:

1. we cannot delete
1. we cannot commit

We don't know what we're doing.

Ok, now we are getting somewhere, sortof I guess.

* We've succeeded in making a repo on Github
* Working on it on the laptop
* Adding a file and editing it and updating the repon on Github
